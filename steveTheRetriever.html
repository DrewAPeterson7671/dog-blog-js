    <h3>A little about me</h3>
    <p>My name is Steve, and I am 9 months old. I am named after the monkey "Steve" from <em>Clouldy With a Chance of Meatballs </em>because of my wild personality. I live with my dad in Atlanta. My silly Dad does not realize that I am in charge, but we still have a pretty good time.</p>
